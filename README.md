# Step-by-step NLP with Disaster Tweets
This repository holds the code from the project “Step-by-step NLP with Disaster Tweets” that was published on Kaggle on Nov 25, 2022.

## Introduction

In this project, I took a step-by-step approach and started with EDA with #pandas, #matplotlib, #seaborn, and #wordcloud. I then preprocessed 10,876 Tweets using #Python and #RegEx, created 10 features using #NLTK and #spaCy, built and evaluated multiple classification models using #scikit-learn, and made predictions on whether a given Tweet is about an actual disaster or not. 

The Logistic Regression model was selected as the final model after performing cross validation and hyperparameter optimization using #RandomizedSearchCV, and the predictions were submitted to Kaggle’s Getting Started Competition, “Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets”.
